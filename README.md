Overview

Welcome to Ahmed-AV, a web application designed to detect gender from images or video inputs using artificial intelligence. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze visual data and predict gender with high accuracy. It is built as a user-friendly website, allowing users to upload images or use webcam input for real-time gender detection.

This repository is part of my portfolio, showcasing my work in AI, computer vision, and web development. Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!

Features





Image-Based Gender Detection: Upload an image to predict the gender of the person in it.



Real-Time Detection: Use a webcam for live gender detection (if supported).



User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive web interface for easy interaction.



AI-Powered: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.

Tech Stack





Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (assumed, e.g., Bootstrap for styling)



Backend: Python with Flask (assumed for web server)



AI/ML: OpenCV, TensorFlow, or a pre-trained model for gender detection



Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt

Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:





Python 3.8 or higher



Node.js (if frontend uses JavaScript frameworks like React)



Git



A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)



(Optional) A webcam for real-time detection

Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/ahmedrehan505-ai/ahmed-av.git
cd ahmed-av



Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate



Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Download Pre-Trained Model (if applicable):





If the project uses a pre-trained model (e.g., for gender detection), download it from [link-to-model-if-available] and place it in the models/ directory.



Alternatively, follow the instructions in train_model.py to train your own model (if provided).



Run the Application:

python app.py





This starts the Flask server (assumed to be app.py).



Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the website.





Access the Website:




Navigate to http://localhost:5000 after starting the server.



You should see the gender detector interface.



Upload an Image:





Use the "Upload Image" button to select an image file.



The system will process the image and display the predicted gender.



Real-Time Detection (if enabled):





Click the "Start Webcam" button to enable live detection.



Ensure your webcam is connected and permissions are granted.
